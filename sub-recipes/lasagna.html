            <h3>Directions</h3>
                <ul>
                <b>Step 1</b><br>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.<br>
                <b>Step 2</b><br>
                Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
                <br>
                <b>Step 3</b><br>
                Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir flour, salt, and pepper into the melted margarine until smooth and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Add milk and broth into flour mixture, stirring constantly; bring sauce to a boil. Stir wine into sauce and remove from heat. Stir Parmesan cheese into sauce until smooth.
                <br>
                <b>Step 4</b><br>
                Whisk ricotta cheese, egg, and egg white together in a bowl.
                <br>
                <b>Step 5</b><br>
                Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute carrots, zucchini, and spinach until just becoming tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir vegetable mixture into ricotta mixture.
                <br>
                <b>Step 6</b><br>
                Layer 1/3 the lasagna noodles, 1/3 the ricotta-vegetable mixture, and 1/3 the Parmesan sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish; repeat layering 2 more times with remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese.
                <br>
                <b>Step 7</b><br>
                Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is lightly browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes.
